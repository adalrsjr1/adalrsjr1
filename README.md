### Hi there üëã

I am a researcher and software engineer with strong experience in modeling and
runtime adaptation of distributed systems. Most of my work was on projects to
enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) of systems in dynamic environments, such
Cloud and Smart Spaces (IoT). During my Ph.D. Thesis, I carried out research to
improve the performance and reduce the resource consumption of cloud-native
applications through the smartly placing application components in the cluster.
To achieve it, I designed and implemented a controller to observe the
application behavior and move application components across the cluster
according to their runtime behavior. In the experiments I could reach up to 60%
of performance improvement. Currently, I am researching at IBM Software Lab.
(CAS - Center for Advanced Studies, Canada). In this new project, I aim to
enhance the IBM Cloud infrastructure to perform self-tuning on Cloud-Native
Applications. The expected outcome of this project is the optimization of cloud
applications at runtime based on the analysis of their incoming workloads.

### Experience üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

**University of British Columbia, Canada ‚Äî Postdoc Fellow**
</br>NOVEMBER 2019 - CURRENT 
</br>_I am a researcher settled at IBM's Center for Advanced Studies (Markham-Ca)
working on self-tuning cloud-native applications. My research aims to enhance
the IBM Cloud infrastructure to perform self-tuning on Cloud-Native Applications
to automatically extract the max performance of the applications based on
analysis of their behaviour and resource utilization._

**Federal University of Goi√°s, Brazil ‚Äî Postdoc Fellow**
</br>MARCH 2019 - NOVEMBER 2019 
</br>_I was a researcher at the Interscity project working on a domain-specific
modeling language to control smart devices without low-level programming in the
domain of Smart Cities. A Middleware interprets this language, abstracting the
low-level details of devices for the domain specialist, which only deal with
high-level concepts of the Smart Cities domain._

**Glaucia Maria Amaral & Cia Ltda, Brazil ‚Äî Information Analyst**
</br>FEBRUARY 2018 - NOVEMBER 2019
</br>_I was responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and security of the information
system and networks of the company. My main contribution to this job was the
design and implementation of the information system to aid the creation of
reports and management of employee‚Äôs workflow._

**University of British Columbia, Canada ‚Äî Researcher**
</br>MARCH 2017 - DECEMBER 2017
</br>_In partnership with IBM-Canada, I built up a model to provide a unified view of
microservices and clusters, abstracting the technologies involved in DevOps
activities and providing a uniform management API, agnostic of technology steer
the evolution of the microservices-based application._
* Design and creation of a model to abstract microservices-based environments
* Development of an engine to manage the whole system cluster based on the model changes

**Federal University of Pernambuco, Brazil ‚Äî Assistant Professor**
</br>MARCH 2015 - MARCH 2017
</br>_Lecturer of Numerical Methods and C Programming for undergrad students of
engineering._
* Organized, implemented and monitored programs and assessments for
classes of roughly 70 students
* Preparation of educational materials module
writing and supportive handouts covering: basics of the C language, functions
roots, linear systems, fitting curves and interpolation, and numerical
integrations.

**Mori√° Institute of Education and Technology Development, Brazil - Soft. Engineer and Researcher**
</br>JANUARY 2012 - SEPTEMBER 2013
</br>_I was one of the software engineers
responsible for developing a minimal viable product of a dentistry aid-software
for help on composite resin teeth restoration. The tool was a decision support
  software to increase the predictability of teeth restorations through pattern
  matching of dental images, to reduce the duration of the sessions of the
  patient in the dentist's chair, optimize clinical time and reduce the dentist
  costs_.
* Research on statistical methods for pattern matching of low
  contrast images
* Development of a framework for
  recommending the most suitable composite to restore a tooth based on pattern
  matching of teeth photo and the composites' colors.

>Federal University of Goi√°s, Brazil ‚Äî Researcher
</br>MARCH 2010 - MARCH 2014
_I proposed a hierarchical architecture to control Microgrids - a localized group
of electricity sources and loads that normally operates connected to and
synchronous with the traditional power grid, but can also disconnect and function
autonomously as physical or economic conditions dictate -  by using model-driven
managers. The managers allow the execution of graphical models, transforming
them into low-level code, to manage resources in a plant. As the primary
outcome, the management architecture facilitates the development of applications
for the Microgrids domain._
* Design of the hierarchical architecture to manage Microgrid
* Development of the managers to interpret model to control Microgrids
